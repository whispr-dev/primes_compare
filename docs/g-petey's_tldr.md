TL;DR

- Skip even numbers: Halves array size & iteration count.
- Use a compact bitset: Fewer loads/stores, better cache usage.
- enable compiler optimizations: -O3 -march=native -flto, or the Rust equivalents.
- Consider parallel or segmented sieves for huge n.
- In Python: Use NumPy or Numba for big performance gains.
- Check your compiler’s auto-vectorization before going down the intrinsics route.

That’s the gist, fren! Each approach can shave off precious milliseconds, so it’s worth a bit of experimentation to see which combos pay off the most in your environment. Happy optimizing!
